# Project Overview

This project comprises the following simple modules:

- **astar.py:** Contains the implementation of the A* algorithm.
- **lidar.py:** Python script for obtaining lidar data.
- **obstacle_detection.py:** Simple code for obstacle detection.

## Module Descriptions

### astar.py

The `astar.py` file includes the implementation of the A* algorithm for path planning.

### lidar.py

The `lidar.py` file is a Python script designed to fetch lidar data. It works in conjunction with a specific lidar sensor (LDS-01) to real-time retrieve distance data.

### obstacle_detection.py

The `obstacle_detection.py` module contains straightforward obstacle detection code. It utilizes data from the lidar sensor but does not provide detailed path planning or obstacle avoidance functionality.

## Usage

Each module can be used independently. Refer to the comments in each file for more information.
